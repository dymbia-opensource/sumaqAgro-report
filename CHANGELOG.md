## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **PDF Export Pipeline (Pandoc + XeLaTeX):**
    - Lua filter (`pandoc/filters/pdf.lua`) to render HTML images (`<p align="center"><img>`) and HTML tables in the PDF.
    - LaTeX preamble and table of contents placement (`pandoc/latex/preamble.tex`, `pandoc/templates/toc.md`).
    - Delivery file naming (`upc-pre-202620-1asi0729-7742-dymbia-report-<milestone>.pdf`) and Windows build script (`build.ps1`).
- `.gitattributes` to normalize line endings across operating systems.
- Project license (`LICENSE.md`, MIT), contribution guide (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) and changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`).

### Changed
- **Repository Structure:** Moved all Pandoc-related files (`build.yaml`, `metadata.yaml`, `Makefile`, `build.ps1`, filters, LaTeX and templates) into `pandoc/`; PDF output now goes to `pandoc/build/`.
- **Assets Organization:** Grouped images by chapter (`report/assets/img/chapter-1` … `chapter-5`) in kebab-case, renamed `domain-drive-design` to `domain-driven-design` and removed spaces from file names.
- Updated pandoc defaults for GitHub-flavored Markdown.
- PDF cover page now uses the front-matter cover (`01-caratula.md`) as pure Markdown.
- Split student outcome rows per team member.
- Updated directory structure and build instructions in `README.md`.

### Fixed
- Corrupted DPI metadata in wireflow and team images that broke XeLaTeX.
- Spacing, list indentation and heading levels for PDF rendering.
